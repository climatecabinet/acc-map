BIKE RACK:
[aesthetic] purple line in header would look cool as a loading bar

QUESTIONS:
- any idea why this outline thickener isn't showing up?
    - relates to the layer that we're clicking. looking into this
- how to dynamically update sidebar with cc information upon click?
    - done! 
- for Matt:
    - does the regions.fragments field consist of counties?
    - what will the structure for the regions.incumbents array look like? Will it list all of the ids of the elected officials for the region? and then we can look to find out if it is a senator, rep, etc?

TODOs:
- DATA (SG)
-- add VA layer by:
    Option A: merging NJ + VA geojson and uploading to the tools folder
    Option B: storing NJ and VA geojson into one layer (upper)
-- add search functionality based on:
    (1) legislator's name
    (2) state legislative district
    (3) address
-- add next 20 states
-- changing the div based on what you're clicking (it relies on the geojson, but our geojson does not the fields from MongoDB. Should we merge these?)

- STYLING (JE/SG)
-- add toggling from Senate to House (SG)
-- create dropdown bar component (JE/SG) -- next paired programming session
-- apply dropdown bar component to clean jobs, polling, and asthma rates (JE)
-- mockup concept and node linking for showing relevant legislation

- MISC. (TK)
-- move GraphQL API key and Mapbox token into build and production environment variables (rn they're in the gatsby-config file )
-- removing excess from the layers (check project spec sheet google doc. instructions are in there)
-- looking into just showing the state at initial view and then show the state leg districts once the state is clicked
-- dynamic choropleth map (for asthma rates, clean energy job percentages, etc.)
-- look into what unit testing would look like for this map
