BIKE RACK:
[aesthetic] purple line in header would look cool as a loading bar

QUESTIONS:
- any idea why this outline thickener isn't showing up?
    - relates to the layer that we're clicking. looking into this
- how to dynamically update sidebar with cc information upon click?
    - done! 
- for Matt:
    - does the regions.fragments field consist of counties?
        - yes
    - what will the structure for the regions.incumbents array look like? Will it list all of the ids of the elected officials for the region? and then we can look to find out if it is a senator, rep, etc?
        - anything that we want it to look like. schema is flexible

TODOs:
- DATA (SG)
-- research how to query faster (static graph ql)
-- add search functionality based on:
    (1) legislator's name
    (2) state legislative district
    (3) address
-- add next 20 states
-- research how to apply a choropleth to the geojson (our geojson does not have the fields from MongoDB. Should we merge these? Or create temporary arrays and add them as a property to the geojson?)
-- mockup concept and node linking for showing relevant legislation

- STYLING (JE/SG)
-- creating a div component for Asthma Rates and clicking to just show 1 district (small test for figuring how choropleth process)
-- add toggling from Senate to House (SG)
-- create dropdown bar component (JE/SG) -- next paired programming session
-- apply dropdown bar component to clean jobs, polling, and asthma rates (JE)

- MISC. (TK)
-- move GraphQL API key and Mapbox token into build and production environment variables (rn they're in the gatsby-config file )
-- removing excess from the layers (check project spec sheet google doc. instructions are in there)
-- looking into just showing the state at initial view and then show the state leg districts once the state is clicked
-- dynamic choropleth map (for asthma rates, clean energy job percentages, etc.)
-- look into what unit testing would look like for this map
